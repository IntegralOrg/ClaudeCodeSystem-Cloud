## [2026-07-24] - Add /morning-precheck and /reconcile

Two commands ported into the cloud edition, cloud-native from the start (no local-machine assumptions to strip).

### Added
- **`/morning-precheck`** (`.claude/commands/morning-precheck.md` + `cowork-commands/morning-precheck.md`) -- headless research pass that runs as a scheduled [Routine](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines) in Claude Code on the web (~6:30 AM weekdays), before the interactive `/morning`. Fans out parallel Task-tool subagents against Gmail, Slack, Calendar, and Fathom transcripts to verify what is actually still open; auto-marks HIGH-confidence completions in the client Inbox files; and writes `Inbox/Morning Precheck.md` for `/morning` to consume later that morning. Bakes in three hard-won rules: **done-by-anyone counts** (a teammate resolving the request is done for the user), **full-thread reading** (not just sender-side signals), and **exact-line matching instead of keyword matching** (keyword matches can wrongly check off the wrong task). `AskUserQuestion` is explicitly forbidden -- ambiguous items go to `## Confirm` for `/morning` to ask about later. Auto-retries the push on rejection (3 attempts, `git pull --rebase origin main` between each), since there is no user around to run the rebase manually in a headless Routine.
- **`/reconcile`** (`.claude/commands/reconcile.md` + `cowork-commands/reconcile.md`) -- interactive light EOD counterpart to `/eod`. Walks the day's time blocks and captures four states per block (done / carried / **skipped** / new-followup) so plan-adherence is honest -- silently dropping missed blocks inflates the metric and hides the pattern the user wants to see. Checks off the client Inbox files, patches Google Calendar with actuals prefixed `[done]` / `[carried]` / `[skipped]` so the calendar becomes a historical record of how time was actually spent, and upserts a row into `Work/Daily/Plan Adherence Log.md` for day-over-day trend visibility. Same 3-attempt push-retry loop, so a concurrent EOD Routine landing between the local commit and push cannot strand the reconcile.

### Design notes
- Both commands use inline `[YOUR_UTC_OFFSET]` and `[YOUR_IANA_TIMEZONE]` placeholders for timezone (not `.env` vars), matching the repo's existing `[Your Timezone]` / `[Client A]` / `[YourCompany]` customization pattern -- one-time swap when installing, not runtime config.
- `/morning-precheck` uses `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(...)` for the Slack look-back timestamp so it resolves to 8:00 AM in the user's real timezone. The cloud container runs UTC by default, so a naive `time.mktime(...timetuple())` would have made "yesterday 8 AM" resolve five hours off for a US-East user.
- `/morning-precheck` runs `mkdir -p Inbox/` before writing the state file to protect a bare-fresh vault where `/onboard` has not yet created the folder.
- `/reconcile` is intentionally NOT a Routine candidate. It needs the user present to name exceptions ("which planned blocks did NOT happen?"); a headless variant would either auto-mark everything done (dishonest) or auto-mark everything skipped (useless).

## [2026-07-09] - Git Autopilot: Version Control Becomes Invisible to the User

Users of the cloud edition must never have to think about Git, GitHub, branches, pull requests, or merge conflicts. The biggest delivery risk was divergence: cloud sessions work on harness-assigned `claude/*` branches, stop to ask about PRs, or die without pushing, so changes never reach `main` and parallel sessions fork the vault. This release makes convergence on `main` continuous and self-healing, with three layers:

### Added
- **Git Autopilot section in `templates/CLAUDE.md`** (plus a rewritten persistence guideline #21). Standing, durable owner authorization that every session reads: `main` is the only branch that matters; sync (`git pull --rebase origin main`) at the start of every session and command; commit and push after every completed unit of work (never more than ~15 minutes unpushed); NEVER create a pull request or ask the user to review/approve/merge one; when the harness assigns a designated `claude/*` branch, push it and then also land the commits on `main` directly (`git push origin HEAD:main` after rebasing); resolve every merge conflict autonomously (Markdown: keep both sides; generated files like `Today.md`: newest wins; config: merge keys, newer value on collision); never surface Git mechanics to the user, except plainly reporting repeated push failures.
- **`templates/vault-autosync.yml`** -- a GitHub Actions safety net installed by `/onboard` at `.github/workflows/vault-autosync.yml` in the vault. Independent of any session's behavior, it merges every non-`main` branch into `main` (Markdown union-merges; other conflicts resolve toward the branch, which carries the newer work), pushes, and deletes the merged branch (which also closes any stray PR). Triggers: every side-branch push, PR opened/reopened, hourly sweep, manual dispatch. Serialized via a concurrency group; push retries with re-merge if `main` moves mid-run. So even a session that only pushed its designated `claude/*` branch and vanished converges within the hour.
- **`.gitattributes` in every new vault** (onboard 6A): `*.md merge=union`, so parallel sessions appending to the same Markdown files (inbox files, daily notes) merge cleanly on both the session side and the Action side instead of raising conflicts. Verified: concurrent edits to the same task file keep both sides' lines with no conflict stop.

### Changed
- **`onboard.md` (Code + CoWork copies)**: 6A now creates `.gitattributes` and installs the autosync workflow unconditionally (never ask the user about it); 7A gains a fallback for tokens that cannot push workflow files (`workflows` scope) -- create the file via the session's GitHub tools, or push everything else and log a TODO; 7A's confirmation wording now promises "you never need to touch GitHub yourself."

The first Cloud Edition pass changed the wording; this pass changes the behavior. The cloud workspace is temporary -- a fresh clone at session start, recycled at session end -- so anything the system wants to keep has to be pushed, and anything it wants in every session has to live in the repository (or the environment settings), not the workspace.

### Fixed
- **Nothing ever committed or pushed.** The docs called Git "the durability layer," but no command ran `git commit`/`git push`, so every EOD close-out, morning plan, and brain dump died with the workspace. Every writing command (`eod`, `morning`, `brain-dump`, `learn`, `graph-sync`, `graph-daily`, `handoff`) now ends with an explicit commit-and-push step, and `templates/CLAUDE.md` gains a global persistence guideline (#21) covering ad-hoc work.
- **`/handoff` + `/pickup` were broken across cloud sessions.** A handoff written to `.handoffs/` but never pushed could not reach the next session (which starts from a fresh clone). `/handoff` now commits and pushes the handoff (new Step 3.5) and warns about other unpushed changes; `/pickup` pulls first, treats old local-CLI memory paths (`~/.claude/projects/...`) as unavailable, and knows background processes never survive into a new session.
- **Onboarding built the vault on disposable disk.** Phase 6A offered `~/Documents/Brain` and `~/Desktop/Brain` -- paths that evaporate with the workspace. The vault now gets its own private GitHub repository (created during 6A), and a new Phase 7A pushes everything before wrap-up. Vault structure now includes a `.gitignore`.
- **Settings written to ephemeral locations.** Permissions went to `~/.claude/settings.json` (home folder of a temporary workspace) and `settings.local.json` (untracked). Durable permissions now live in the vault's **committed** `.claude/settings.json` (onboard 6D, `/connect`, onboarding guide); MCP servers move from home settings to the vault's committed `.mcp.json` with `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders instead of raw secrets. `examples/settings.json` drops the macOS-only `additionalDirectories` (`$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents`, etc.).
- **Secrets story.** `.env` is now documented everywhere as a session-local, untracked scratch copy; the permanent home for credentials is environment variables in the Claude Code environment settings (onboard 6C rewritten, `/connect` saves to both and verifies, glossary updated).

### Changed
- **Local scheduling replaced by cloud Routines.** Deleted `examples/scripts/eod-runner.sh`, `eod-cron.sh`, and `com.brain.eod-runner.plist` (macOS launchd/iCloud/Gatekeeper machinery, contradicting "nothing to install"). README FAQ, `docs/daily-workflow.md`, and `docs/integration-architecture.md` now describe scheduled Routines in Claude Code on the web (`/eod` on a weekday-night schedule, runs and pushes in the cloud). `md-to-gdoc.py` stays -- it runs fine in the workspace.
- **CoWork story made consistent.** Onboard 6E copies `cowork-commands/` into the vault for Cowork users (upload-ready, no walkthrough), and the repo `CLAUDE.md` maintenance notes match reality again. Remaining Desktop/CLI trichotomy references in `templates/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/integration-architecture.md` reframed for the single cloud runtime.
- `.gitignore`: dropped the leftover `.obsidian/` block.

## [2026-07-08] - Cloud Edition: Drop Obsidian and Local-Machine Framing

### Changed
- **The documentation no longer describes the system as "built on Obsidian" or as running on the user's local machine.** This is the cloud edition -- it runs in Claude Code on the web, and the vault is a Git repository of Markdown files that Claude reads and writes directly in a cloud workspace. The system is now described as **built on Claude Code and a Git-backed Markdown vault**.
- **`README.md`**: rewrote the tagline, "What you will need," and Get Started sections for the cloud edition; removed the Windows local-install section (Git Bash / Developer Mode / Virtual Machine Platform); relabeled the architecture diagram's "Obsidian Vault" box to "Git-Backed Vault (Markdown)"; replaced the iCloud atomic-write note; updated the Windows/Linux and cost FAQs.
- **`docs/onboarding-guide.md`**: dropped the "Pick Your Claude Interface" (Desktop vs CLI) step and the "Install Obsidian" step; reframed requirements, permission descriptions, the `/connect` and morning steps, and the glossary for the cloud edition.
- **`docs/vault-design-guide.md`**: retitled and rewrote "Why Obsidian?" as "Why a Git-backed Markdown vault?"; updated the core-idea, template-placeholder, atomic-writes, and "what makes this different" sections.
- **`docs/integration-architecture.md`**, **`docs/daily-workflow.md`**, **`templates/CLAUDE.md`**: relabeled the vault, dropped the Desktop/CoWork/CLI trichotomy and iCloud/Dropbox sync-race rationale, and reframed wiki-links as the graph convention (not "clickable in Obsidian").
- **Commands** (`onboard`, `train`, `finish`, `graph-sync`, `graph-daily`, `eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `monthly-review`, `brain-dump`, `morning`) and their `cowork-commands/` mirrors: removed "Open Obsidian" instructions, the "nothing is in the cloud / on your machine" framing, `.obsidian/` exclusions, and the iCloud atomic-write rule.
- **Repo `CLAUDE.md`**: bootstrap detection no longer keys on `.obsidian/`; it now detects an existing vault by its contents (`CLAUDE.md`, `Inbox/`, `Work/`).

---

## [2026-06-18] - Single Command Folder: Removed examples/commands/, Unconditional Install

### Fixed
- **Commands were silently dropped during onboarding.** `onboard.md` Phase 6E used a hand-enumerated, conditional install list: `morning.md`/`eod.md`/`daily-note.md`/`brain-dump.md` only installed if the user picked the matching Phase 5 workflow preference, and the five EOD phase commands (`eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `eod-time`, `eod-note`, `eod-today`) were never installed at all. Because `/eod` and its phase commands reference each other, a half-installed pipeline broke mid-run after the user invoked a slash command.

### Changed
- **Phase 6E now installs every command unconditionally** via a glob copy of `.claude/commands/*.md` (minus `onboard.md`), in both the CLI and CoWork paths. Workflow preferences only affect which command is *recommended* and how tool-specific ones are *customized*, never whether a file is installed. There is no longer any hand-maintained install list to fall out of sync.
- **Removed the `examples/commands/` folder.** Its 10 commands (`eod`, `eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `eod-time`, `eod-note`, `eod-today`, `morning`, `monthly-review`, `brain-dump`, `daily-note`) moved into `.claude/commands/` via `git mv`. There is now exactly one source folder for Code commands. The "examples" framing was the root cause of the drift: it made shipped commands look optional. `examples/` retains only `settings*.json` and `scripts/`.
- **Docs updated**: repo `CLAUDE.md` (Dual-Format table + maintenance rule), `README.md` (repository-structure tree), `docs/vault-design-guide.md`, and `finish.md` (both Code + CoWork copies) no longer reference `examples/commands/`.

## [2026-06-10] - Handoffs Moved Out of .claude/ to .handoffs/

### Changed
- **Handoff storage moved from `.claude/handoffs/` to `.handoffs/` at the working-directory root** (`/handoff`, `/pickup`, `/onboard` Phase 6E, README — both `.claude/commands/` and `cowork-commands/` copies). Claude Code's hardcoded sensitive-file guard prompts on EVERY Write/Edit under `.claude/` directories and cannot be suppressed by permission allow rules, PreToolUse hooks, or PermissionRequest hooks (verified empirically; known open bug anthropics/claude-code#41615, including the dialog's non-persisting "always allow" option). Moving the directory out of `.claude/` is the only way to make handoff writes prompt-free.
- **`/pickup` legacy fallback extended**: if `.handoffs/` is missing or empty but `.claude/handoffs/` has files, read from there and suggest migrating them (covers projects not yet moved).

### Migration
- Per project: `mv .claude/handoffs .handoffs` and gitignore `.handoffs/` (keep the old `.claude/handoffs/` ignore line for stragglers).

---

## [2026-06-03] - Remove Legacy /resume Command

### Removed
- **`/resume` deleted** (`examples/commands/resume.md` + `cowork-commands/resume.md`) and dropped from the onboard Phase 6E install lists. It drove the obsolete single global `~/.claude/handoff.md` pattern that `/pickup`'s legacy note warns against. Use `/handoff` + `/pickup` (named, per-project, multiple active handoffs) instead.

---

## [2026-06-03] - Handoff/Pickup Promoted to the Standard Command Set

### Changed
- **`/handoff` and `/pickup` moved from `examples/commands/` into the standard set `.claude/commands/`.** They are now core commands every user receives during setup (like `/onboard`, `/strategy`, `/learn`), not optional examples. One source of truth per command.
- **`/pickup` updated to the latest functionality**: explicit "Step 0: Resolve Which Handoff to Read" (lists actual handoffs and asks rather than silently falling back), a legacy-note guard against stale root `handoff.md` orphans hijacking a resume, and split Read / Freshness-check steps.
- **`onboard.md` Phase 6E**: handoff/pickup now install from `.claude/commands/` under an "Always copy these session-continuity skills (every user gets these)" block, with rationale on why they exist (context + task management, hand off / pick up conversations, persistent track record in the vault).
- **`cowork-commands/handoff.md` and `pickup.md`** synced to the new bodies (YAML frontmatter preserved).
- **README**: added a "Session Continuity (`/handoff` and `/pickup`)" key-concept section and listed both in the repository-structure tree under `.claude/commands/`.

### Removed
- `examples/commands/handoff.md` and `examples/commands/pickup.md` (moved to the standard set; no longer duplicated in examples).

---

## [2026-04-28] - Brainstorming Skill + Local Handoff Files

### Added
- **Brainstorming community skill** installed during onboarding via `npx skills add https://github.com/obra/superpowers --skill brainstorming`
- Added `/brainstorming` to the strategy skills walkthrough in `train.md`

### Changed
- **Handoff/Pickup now write to the current working directory** instead of global `~/.claude/handoff.md`. Each project gets its own `handoff.md`, so multiple projects can have independent active handoffs.
