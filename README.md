# Claude Code Personal Assistant System

An AI-powered personal assistant built on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and a Git-backed Markdown vault. The vault is the operating system; Claude Code is the brain. Together they handle task management, meeting processing, email triage, time tracking, client work, and daily planning -- replacing a human executive assistant.

This is the **cloud edition**: it runs in [Claude Code on the web](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web), in your browser. Your vault is a Git repository of Markdown files that Claude reads and writes directly in a cloud workspace -- nothing to install on your own computer.

> **You do not need to be technical.** Claude will walk you through everything step by step.
>
> **What you will need:** A GitHub account (for your vault repository) and a [Claude subscription](https://claude.ai) that includes Claude Code on the web.

## Get Started

1. Create (or pick) a GitHub repository to hold your vault, and open it in [Claude Code on the web](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web).
2. Add this setup repo's files to that workspace if they are not already there.
3. Type `/onboard` to begin.

**Already have a vault repository?** Drop this setup repo's files into it, then say:

> Set me up

Claude will find the setup files, copy the commands into place, and start the process automatically.

Either way, Claude interviews you in a friendly question-and-answer format (no manual file editing). The full setup has 4 parts:

| Step | Command | What It Does | Time |
|------|---------|-------------|------|
| 1 | `/onboard` | Learn about you, build your vault folders and files | ~20 min |
| 2 | `/train` | Walk through your vault, skills, and the daily loop | ~15 min |
| 3 | `/connect` | Connect each of your tools (calendar, email, tasks, etc.) one by one | ~20 min |
| 4 | `/finish` | Live demo with real data, improvement tips, how to maximize the system | ~10 min |

Each part ends by telling you what to type next. You can pause between parts and pick up later.

> For a detailed reference of what gets set up, see the [Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding-guide.md).

## How It Works

**The daily loop:**
1. **End of day** -- Run `/eod` before wrapping up. Claude processes your calls, emails, Slack, and tasks, then builds tomorrow's plan. You can walk away while it runs.
2. **Morning** -- Read `Inbox/Today.md` (pre-built schedule, priorities, meeting prep)
3. **Morning** -- Run `/morning` (3-5 min interactive review: confirm plan, adjust, create calendar blocks)
4. **All day** -- Work with Claude Code as needed (drafting, research, task management, document creation)
5. **End of day** -- Cycle repeats

## What the Setup Creates

By the end of all 4 steps, you will have (see the [Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding-guide.md) for details):

- **Permissions** configured so Claude can work without interrupting you
- **Notes folder** (a Git-backed Markdown vault) with organized folders for clients, projects, and tasks
- **Instruction manual** (CLAUDE.md) customized with your name, schedule, clients, and preferences
- **Tool connections** to your calendar, email, task manager, and other services
- **Skills** for morning review, end-of-day processing, and other workflows
- **Understanding** of how the system works and how to improve it over time

## Key Concepts

### CLAUDE.md
The instruction file at your vault root. Claude reads it automatically every session. It defines your folder structure, integrations, preferences, workflows, and routing rules. Think of it as Claude's operating manual. Keep it under 30K characters; move detailed content to reference files.

### Skills
Successful tasks turned into repeatable routines. Each skill is a text file that defines a multi-step workflow. Type `/skill-name` and Claude runs the full process. Examples: `/eod-gather` (collect all daily data), `/morning` (interactive morning review), `/audit-deliver` (populate a client portal). Your skills library grows over time as you turn successful one-off tasks into reusable routines.

**Two formats exist for different runtimes:**
- **Claude Code:** Skills live in `.claude/commands/` and are auto-discovered. No special formatting needed.
- **Claude CoWork:** Skills require YAML frontmatter (`name:` and `description:` fields in a `---` block) and must be manually uploaded through the **Customize** section in the app settings. The `cowork-commands/` directory contains pre-formatted versions of all skills ready for upload.

### Session Continuity (`/handoff` and `/pickup`)
Every user gets these two commands. They solve the single biggest limitation of working with an AI agent: a session's memory is finite. When the context window fills up, or you run `/clear`, close the window, or the conversation gets compacted, everything that was only "in the chat" is gone.

- **`/handoff <name>`** writes a self-contained briefing to `.handoffs/<name>.md` -- the goal, what's been done, what was tried and rejected, the exact next steps, and which files and commands the next session should reload -- then **commits and pushes it** (cloud sessions start from a fresh clone, so an unpushed handoff would never reach the next one). Run it before `/clear`, before ending a session mid-task, or whenever a long conversation is getting unwieldy. The handoff is written *to the next Claude*, not to you, so it reads like a briefing for a colleague who just walked in.
- **`/pickup [name]`** (in the next session) reads that file, reloads the listed context in parallel, sanity-checks it against the current state of the repo, and reports back where you left off, all without you re-explaining anything. With no argument it lists the available handoffs and asks which to resume.

Because each handoff is a named, persistent file inside the vault, they accumulate into a **track record of in-flight workstreams**: you can keep several open across different projects, and old ones stay put until you delete them. This is better task and context management than holding everything in one long chat. Use it for mid-stream work; `/eod` still handles end-of-day wrap-up and routing items to your task inboxes.

> Named `/pickup` (not `/resume`) so it doesn't shadow Claude Code's built-in `/resume` session picker.

### Tracking Lists (The Manifest Pattern)
Long-running workflows track every extracted item in a tracking list (`/tmp/eod-manifest-TODAY.md`). Each item gets: description, client, type, source, destination, status. This makes sure nothing gets lost during long processes.

### File Writes
Your vault is a Git repository in a cloud workspace -- there is no background file sync racing against Claude's edits, so the built-in editor is safe for reads and writes. Git history is your safety net: commit and push to persist changes and roll back if needed.

### Route-As-You-Go
Every extracted item is routed to its destination file immediately, not batched for later. This prevents data loss if a step fails partway through or the process runs long.

### EOD Command
The default `/eod` flow should run as one command in one Claude session. Claude Code now supports long-context sessions, so the simplest setup is a single `/eod` that gathers, routes, syncs, writes the daily note, and builds tomorrow's plan. If a user's workflow is unusually heavy, or if they want unattended scheduled automation, you can still split EOD into separate phases as an advanced fallback.

## FAQ

**Do I need all these tool connections?**
No. Start with Calendar + Email + your meeting transcript service. Add connections as you need them.

**Do I need to install anything?**
No. This is the cloud edition -- it runs in Claude Code on the web, in your browser. There is nothing to install on your own computer; you only need a GitHub account for your vault repository. It works from any Mac, Windows, or Linux machine with a browser.

**How much does this cost?**
Claude Code on the web requires a [Claude subscription](https://claude.ai). Connections to Google, Slack, and similar services are within their free tiers for personal use. Some tools (like meeting transcript services or time trackers) have their own pricing.

**Can I use this for a team?**
The system is designed for one person. You could adapt it for a small team, but it would need significant customization.

**What if the EOD routine fails partway through?**
If you are using the default one-command `/eod`, just run it again after fixing the issue. If you later adopt the advanced phased version, you can re-run only the failed phase.

**Can I automate the EOD to run on a schedule?**
Yes. Create a scheduled [Routine](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines) in Claude Code on the web: point it at your vault repository with the prompt `/eod` and a schedule like 11:30 PM on weekdays. It runs in the cloud and pushes the results, so tomorrow's plan is ready when you sit down -- no computer left on, no cron jobs, no terminal setup. Most users still just run `/eod` manually before wrapping up for the day.
